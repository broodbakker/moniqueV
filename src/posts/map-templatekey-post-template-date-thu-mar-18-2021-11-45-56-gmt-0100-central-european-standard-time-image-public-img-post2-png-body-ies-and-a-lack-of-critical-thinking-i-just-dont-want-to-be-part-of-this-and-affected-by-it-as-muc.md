ies and a lack of critical thinking. I just don't want to be part of this and affected by it as much as I can, I want to reject it all and go against the grain and live a slower, simpler life.

One small thing I can do is encourage a few other people to also go against the grain and read a book instead of scrolling a feed, and focus on a few deeper relationships as opposed to collecting and quantifying strangers. I'm learning to be my own best friend. I deleted all my tweets and stopped scrolling through Twitter, I removed my email from any easy-to-find spot, and I make sure not to log into anything like Reddit. Without being tailored to my interests, you'll find that most of these sites are pretty boring and it's easy to just check something out for a few minutes and move on.

I found the latest three articles on The Raptitude interesting and helpful, so I'll share them with you.

* [How to Handle the Beast](https://www.raptitude.com/2020/12/how-to-handle-the-beast/) - it was helpful for me to read this and know that other people struggle with a lack of productivity and drive, and that it's okay and normal.
* [News is the Last Thing We Need Right Now](https://www.raptitude.com/2020/12/news-is-the-last-thing-we-need-right-now/) - real news, fake world.
* [Own the Tools](https://www.raptitude.com/2020/12/own-the-tools/) - why it might be a better idea to - for example - open a physical dictionary to find a word as opposed to looking it up online.

Meanwhile, I've been making the best of this weird time. I'm really glad that I still enjoy my job quite a bit and the puzzle-solving aspect of coding that makes it so fun and challenging, but I've wanted to explore things outside of coding in my spare time that makes more use of my hands. I built a PC from scratch. I learned some basic woodworking skills to make my own desk. I learned how to knit. I painted some Bob Ross paintings. I climbed one of the tallest mountains in the U.S. and slept among the stars above the tree line. I took a solo road trip along the coast from L.A. to Seattle in an oversized Jeep Wrangler. I started a new job. I've just been livin'.

Here's me on top of Mount Langley.

Here's my first finished scarf, that I just made last week.

Here's the desk and PC I built.

1. Aside from my thoughts, here are some of the stats I usually keep track of.

### [](https://www.taniarascia.com/2020-into-2021/#i-finished-takenote)I finished TakeNote

[TakeNote](https://takenote.dev/) is my biggest project yet, and I wrote all about it [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/building-takenote/). It's a web-based note-taking app for developers that looks like an IDE and syncs to GitHub. It uses TypeScript, Node, Express, React, Redux, Codemirror, and several other awesome open-source projects. I
